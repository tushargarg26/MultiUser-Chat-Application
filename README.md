# MultiUser-Chat-Application

**OverView**
We have created a Multi User Chat Application Based on Java in which if one user sends a message then it will be
broadcasted to all the other clients or users.

**Technologies Used**
We have used Java, **Socket Programming** to create the Client-Server Relationship and
**JDBC** as an API to connect our interface with the Database.

**Flow of the application**
When User open the application a Login/Register Screen will appear when a new user enters all the details and press register
then the details will be stored in the database and password be saved in a encrypted format in database.
We have used MD5 encryption technique to encrypt the password.
After registration when user clicks on the Login Button a new screen will appear and in the menu bar a Start chat option is available 
after clicking on Start Chat, a chat interface will open and you can chat on the other active users on the Server.
